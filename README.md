# 3D Reconstruction using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)

## Overview
This project implements a cutting-edge 3D reconstruction pipeline that combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for neural volumetric rendering with Agisoft Metashapeâ€™s photogrammetry tools. The system creates highly detailed and photorealistic 3D scenes from 2D images, enabling novel viewpoint rendering and precise texture mapping.

## Features
- Continuous volumetric scene modeling using NeRF  
- Camera pose estimation using COLMAP  
- Sparse and dense point cloud generation with Agisoft Metashape  
- 3D mesh reconstruction and texture mapping  
- Python scripting for data preprocessing, training, and rendering  
- Optimization techniques to enhance 3D model fidelity


 Setup Agisoft Metashape and COLMAP as per their official instructions.

## Usage
- Prepare images with known camera poses or run COLMAP for pose estimation.  
- Train NeRF model on posed images using provided scripts.  
- Render novel views and generate 3D mesh with texture mapping in Metashape.  

## Technologies Used
- PyTorch for neural radiance field modeling  
- Agisoft Metashape for photogrammetry and mesh reconstruction  
- COLMAP for camera pose estimation  
- Python for scripting and data processing  

## Applications
- Virtual reality scene generation  
- Cultural heritage preservation  
- Robotics and environment mapping
