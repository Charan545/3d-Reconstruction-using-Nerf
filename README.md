# 3D Reconstruction using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)

## Overview
This project implements a cutting-edge 3D reconstruction pipeline that combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for neural volumetric rendering with Agisoft Metashapeâ€™s photogrammetry tools. The system creates highly detailed and photorealistic 3D scenes from 2D images, enabling novel viewpoint rendering and precise texture mapping.

## Features
- Continuous volumetric scene modeling using NeRF  
- Camera pose estimation using COLMAP  
- Sparse and dense point cloud generation with Agisoft Metashape  
- 3D mesh reconstruction and texture mapping  
- Python scripting for data preprocessing, training, and rendering  
- Optimization techniques to enhance 3D model fidelity


 Setup Agisoft Metashape and COLMAP as per their official instructions.
## Steps we implemented
1) We have taken a video of a ball.
2) Then we have extracted the frames from the video which is basically the ball from all sides or every point of view.

3) Generate a detailed cloud that accurately represents scene geometry in the Agisoft MetaShape
4) Create a 3D surface mesh and apply realistic textures from source images.
